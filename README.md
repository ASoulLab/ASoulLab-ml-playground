ASoulLab Machines Learning Playground
==============================
This is an experimental machine learning playground with multiple experiments including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Character Recognition, Cloud Balancing, etc.

###  Experiments
1. **[NLP demo](./kafka-connect-twitter)**  with `lingPipe`, `Kafka Connect` and `Kafka Streams`
2. **[Character Recognition](./neural-networks)** with Neural Networks `synaptic` on Node.Js
3. **[Cloud Balancing with OR/CP](./constraint-programming)**  with `OptaPlanner`

####  Resilient Predictive Data Pipelines
